    - Thibaut Perol (a deep learning researcher from Harvard) is looking into the use of AI to amplify the sensitivity of the state’s seismographs. This paper^[http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/e1700578] published in the journal Science Advances shows how effective this technique is - capable of detecting 17 times more earthquakes than older methods in a fraction of the time.
