## Overview

Machine learning can be broadly bucketed into three categories:

(1) Supervised Learning
(2) Unsupervised Learning
(3) Reinforcement Learning

Supervised learning encompasses tasks that try to predict something, such as stock price, or whether a picture contains a dog or a cat.  To train a supervised ML model, you must define both input features and outputs, so we call this labeled data.

Unsupervised learning aims to identify structure in unlabeled data, meaning you provide only input features.  Examples include clustering books by topic, identifying when a machine might be faulty due to odd behavior, etc.

Reinforcement learning trains an agent to accomplish a complex goal by identifying the next best step to take.  Examples include playing PacMan or chess.

In each of these categories, an engineer must specify an objective function to maximize or minimize, and define how to incorporate feedback from a correct or incorrect decision back into a model to adjust its parameters.

## Supervised Learning

Within supervised learning, there are typically two tasks we're interested in:

(1) Regression - predicting a continous value, such as housing price
(2) Classification
